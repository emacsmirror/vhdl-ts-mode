;;; Code:


(require 'test-hdl-setup-straight)


;;;; Setup built-in dependencies
(use-package align
  :straight nil
  :config
  (setq align-default-spacing 1)
  (setq align-to-tab-stop nil))


;;;; Install/setup package
;; Always needed since straight.el does not download dependencies of local packages
(use-package vhdl-ts-mode
  :mode (("\\.vhdl?\\'" . vhdl-ts-mode))
  :config
  (setq treesit-font-lock-level 4))

;; Shadow/override with actions/checkout repo, instead of the one downloaded by straight.el
(test-hdl-when-github-action
  (use-package vhdl-ts-mode
   :straight nil))


(provide 'vhdl-ts-mode-test-setup-straight)

;;; vhdl-ts-mode-test-setup-straight.el ends here
