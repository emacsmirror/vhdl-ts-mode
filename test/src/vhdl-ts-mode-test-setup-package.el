;; vhdl-ts-mode ERT Tests Setup with package.el
;;
;; INFO: Packages downloaded from MELPA (not MELPA Stable) will fetch the
;; snapshot of the latest commit in the corresponding Git repo and its
;; dependencies. It would therefore have the same effect as testing with
;; straight but with the issue that test/ code in the repo would not be in sync
;; with the code of the downloaded package until the snapshot is updated
;; (various times per day).
;;
;; For MELPA Stable this is different since package.el will download the tagged
;; version of the repo and all its dependencies.
;;
;;; Code:

;;;; Setup package.el
;; INFO: Perform tests in package.el only in MELPA Stable:
;;  - For bleeding-edge versions use straight and package.el basic test
